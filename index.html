      <p class="title">INTRODUCTION TO PLATE TECTONIC THEORY</p>
      <hr style="background-color: darkblue">

        <p><br>
          Some call it the Grand Unifying Theory of Geology. It could explain what causes mountains to form, why volcanoes are found underwater, and how earthquakes are triggered. Plate tectonics state that the crust and upper mantle are made up of rocky plates that float on a layer of molten rock called the asthenosphere. Because of the intense heat, plates move around one to six inches a year (National Geographic, 2022). Now, although we cannot directly observe what goes on below the surface of the earth, there has been undeniable evidence. This ranges from magnetic pole reversals, a super-continent, fossil locations, seafloor spreading, and most explicitly the fact that when we map out all the tectonic plates, every boundary line is simply a path on which volcanoes are situated (British Geographer, 2012). That is not a coincidence.

        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          Since the lithospheric plates are always moving ever so slowly, they are going to collide with each other. There are three ways in which these plates interact. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is an example of a divergent boundary, which is when they move away from one another, allowing magma to rise through the gap and create oceanic crust. The Pacific Ring of Fire is a convergent boundary, where either buckle up into a mountain or one plate gives in and bends downwards below the other. Lastly, fault zones such as San Andreas are instances of a transform boundary. Two plates slide past each other, thus leading to an earthquake (NOAA, 2018).

          The idea behind Pangea began as a concept by Alfred Wegener. Like other scientists, he saw the distinct similarities between the coastlines of eastern South America and western Africa. As a result, he had an idea that they must have been a part of the same continent that eventually broke off. With that, he formalized this idea into a theory that in the late Paleozoic Era, the continents we have now used to be one massive supercontinent that broke apart, and he called this Pangea (Britannica, 2022)
        </p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          So the relevance this has with Plate Tectonics is that Pangea is solid proof of this concept. For them to break off, the plates must have slowly shifted apart over long periods of geological time, forming the continents we have today. With that being said, he called this theory “die Verschiebung der Kontinente” or Continental Displacement in English. In 1912, this concept was more known as the Continental Drift Theory. Although it makes sense to us now, his work didn't convince the scientific world at that time. With that, a modified version of this theory was made by Alexander L. Du Toit, a South African geologist. Du Toit implied that there were two other primordial continents: Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south. The evidence he attained when he modified Wegener's theory helped give for a successor theory in the 1960s, this theory was then called Plate Tectonics (Britannica, 2022)

        <p><br>
          The rock cycle is a description of the interactions and processes that the three rock types undergo in either their formation or transformation. Moreover, the movement of tectonic plates heavily affects this cycle every step of the way. Igneous rocks, for example, come from hot magma, which at diverging plate boundaries are brought to the surface and cooled (Sciencing, 2017).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          The impact on sediments can be evidently seen with the Himalayas, where the Indian subcontinent converged with Eurasia, leading to a massive uplift. All the sediments were then cast into the Bay of Bengal (PennState, 2010). Additionally, convergent and transform plate boundaries are perfectly conducive to subjecting rocks along the fault line to regional metamorphism (Gardiner & Davies, 2007).
